Iâ€™m currently learning SwiftUI (and Combine).  Both new frameworks from Apple are amazing and pleasant to learn.

To practice what I've learned I made an iOS app-named The Airliners.  It provides brief information on the Boeing 7x7 series aircraft, with all data I get from Wikipedia.

For now, this app is quite simple. For the appearance side, it has only two screens. For the business logic side, it just applies some SwiftUI syntax like `@State`, `@Environment`, `@ObservedObject`, ... I plan to add more features as I'm learning.

The source code for the app can be found [here](https://github.com/Thieurom/the-airliners).
